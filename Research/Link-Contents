 Standard Drones
  Slow and controlled for beautiful recordings
  First Person View (FPV) Drones
  See what the drone sees
  Moves way faster through the air
  Capture unique footage with Go-Pro

  Drone market overflows with different hardware, communication protocols, and software

  Parts needed for a drone
  Frame
  Motors with propellers (create upward thrust while spinning)
  Battery
  Receiver
  Camera
  VTx (Video Transmitter) system with fitting antenna (Takes camera video signal and sends it out as a 5.8GHz signal so that FPV goggles can receive and playback)
  FC (Flight Controlller) board (Heart of the system) (comes with an accelerometer to determine how it is positioned in the air) (Using PID control loop to tell each motor how fast to spin so that it can stand upright in the air without crashing) (Manages the received controller signal, camera signal, output the VTx signal, and much more) (Cannot directly drive the BLDC motors)
  ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) board (Drives the motors at a specific speed depending on how the FC demands it)

  (INSERT WHY PETG IS BETTER THAN PLA)

  Most ofter most motors come with low quality bearings
